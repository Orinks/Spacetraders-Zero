An automated client for the SpaceTraders API game (https://spacetraders.io/). This client provides a robust interface for interacting with the SpaceTraders API, featuring automated trading, resource management, and strategic decision-making capabilities.

## Features

- 🚀 Automated trading and resource management
- 🛸 Ship navigation and fleet management
- 📊 Market analysis and optimal route planning
- 📝 Automated contract handling
- ⚡ High-performance async operations
- 🔒 Secure API token handling
- 🧪 Comprehensive test coverage

Note: there are two mining modes for debugging purposes for now; Coordinated mining I aim to be the default as soon as everything works great. Todo: everything except mining.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- A SpaceTraders API token (The script should handle this for you, but check out the website anyhow) https://spacetraders.io/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Orinks/spacetraders-zero.git
cd spacetraders-zero
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your SpaceTraders API token:

Note: if running for the first time, the .env file will be created for you. Feel free to manually add API tokens if you started a run before the next reset happens.

```
SPACETRADERS_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

```bash
python src/main.py
```
